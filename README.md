## Motivation

> [!NOTE]
>
> Inspired by [@moolmohino](https://www.youtube.com/@moolmohino), I have embarked on a similar journey, committing 1-2 hours daily over the next 100 days to deepen my intuition in deep learning.

In short, I grew tired of simply building Generative AI applications and managing LLM operations in my current role. The routine of calling an API without deeply understanding the process often frustrates me.

I started this repository for my personal growth as I [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public). For context, I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Business Analytics. Since my undergraduate days, I have known that I have a deep passion for solving problems in tech. However, solving bugs and building features never truly excited me. 

Instead, I have always been drawn to more math-related aspects of the field — despite having purposefully avoided math for the longest time due to some secondary school "trauma".

That being said, this repository will document my step-by-step journey of getting hands-on experience and building models from scratch. I'll be diving deep into the math from research papers, experiencing plenty of mind-blowing moments along the way, and likely talking to GPT more than I talk to my partner over the next 100 days.

## Logs

> [!WARNING]
>
> I intend to bombard this section with daily logs of my learning journey. If you're reading this from the future at the end of my 100-day challenge, be prepared to scroll through quite a bit of content.
